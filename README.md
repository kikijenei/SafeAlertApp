# SafeAlertApp

SafeAlert is an Android mini-project focused on first aid and emergency assistance. The app includes features like SOS triggering, emergency contact alerts, location sharing, and sensor-based actions (eg. inactivity detection, volume button triggers).

This project is still in development and serves as a base for experimenting with Android services, broadcast receivers, and emergency response features.

## Main Features (planned or partial)

- SOS alert system (with volume button or inactivity detection)
- Emergency call and SMS helpers
- Location sharing via GPS
- Voice recognition service
- Weather alert service
- Battery level monitoring
- UI with fragments and activity-based navigation

## Technologies

- Java (Android Studio)
- Services and BroadcastReceivers
- Google Maps API (OnMapReadyCallback)
- SensorManager, LocationManager
- Material Design components

## Future Plans

This is a work-in-progress mini-project used for testing features and experimenting with Android service-based architecture.

In the future, I plan to improve the UI, complete the SOS trigger flow, and integrate real-time alerts and notifications.
